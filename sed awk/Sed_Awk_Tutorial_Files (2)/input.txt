Pythagoras divided those who attended his lectures into two groups: the 
Probationers (or listeners) and the Pythagoreans. After three years in 
the first class, a listener could be initiated into the second class, to 
whom were confided the main discoveries of the school. The Pythagoreans 
were a closely knit brotherhood, holding all worldly goods in common and 
bound by an oath not to reveal the founder's secrets. Legend has it that a 
talkative Pythagorean was drowned in a shipwreck as the gods' punishment 
for publicly boasting that he had added the dodecahedron to the number of 
regular solids enumerated by Pythagoras. For a time, the autocratic 
Pythagoreans succeeded in dominating the local government in Croton, but a 
popular revolt in 501 B.C. led to the murder of many of its prominent 
members, and Pythagoras himself was killed shortly thereafter. Although 
the political influence of the Pythagoreans thus was destroyed, they 
continued to exist for at least two centuries more as a philosophical and 
mathematical society. To the end, they remained a secret order, publishing 
nothing and, with noble self-denial, ascribing all their discoveries to 
the Master.
